Installation and execution:

- Extract the source and class files from the jar:

  $ jar xf ODA.jar

- Running the serial version:

  $ java -cp ODA.jar -Xmx1000M SerialODA ODA/corpus/lda en_2005_02.bag ensy_2005_02.bag
  where ODA/corpus/lda is the working directory and en_2005_02.bag, 
  ensy_2005_02.bag the input files.

- Running the parallel version:

  Install MPJ: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mpjexpress/
  
  Running in Multi-core configuration:
  $ mpjrun.sh -np 8 -jar ODA.jar -Xmx1000M ODA/corpus/lda en_2005_02.bag ensy_2005_02.bag

- Visualize the result

  These two programs only writes on the standard outputs the identifiers of the matched
  documents. To visualize the content of these matched documents, you need to run the
  Reader class.

  $ java -cp ODA.jar gui/Reader

  This application reads a file during its creation containing the matched documents
  identifiers. In order to find what our program has found for matched documents, first
  run the parallel or serial version and redirect the standard output into a file. Use
  the Reader to read this file.
